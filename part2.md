## Final Project Part 2

### Wireframes and Storyboard
After the first part of my final project, I made a lot of changes to the narrative of the story. I created the data visualizations for my story in Tableau and Flourish. I added certain basic content pieces and embedded the data visualizations in Shorthand before I conducted my user research. Please review the my draft presentation in Shorthand [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-data-localization-story/index.html)
