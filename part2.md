## Final Project Part 2

### Wireframes and Storyboard
> After the first part of my final project, I made a lot of changes to the narrative of the story. I created the data visualizations for my story in Tableau and Flourish. I added certain basic content pieces and embedded the data visualizations in Shorthand before I conducted my user research. Please review the my draft presentation in Shorthand [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-data-localization-story/index.html)

I am yet to add the final written content and add captions to certain pictures. 

### User Research
1. My target audience for this presentation is any global citizen, who is a non-expert but is curious about technology policy.
2. I recruited interviewees from Heinz who did not know much about data localization. 

3. Questions I asked to the interviewees - 

a) What do you think was the message/motive of the presentation?

b) Was everything clear? Anything that you were confused by/found unusual?

c) Did you find the presentation persuasive? Are you likely to follow the call to action?

d) Did you find this useful?

e) What did you think of the narration/narrative style?

f) What changes would you suggest?

g) What did you think of the visualizations?

4. Response 1

a) To raise voice against localization of data because data localization changes internet.

b) What I found unusual was the extent to which a single event like Snowden revelation affected a large scale international change. 

c) Found it moderately persuasive, not too much. I didn't see so much about how this would affect me personally. I get an idea but don't understand the personal implications clearly.

d)Yes, it helped me learn about a topic that I wasn't much aware of. It wasn't complicated and simple/non-technical words were used. 

e) The narrative style could be more compelling. The start did not catch/draw me in. It could have started with the problems faced and then cause and then solution.

f) Nothing else.

g) The visualizations were easy to grasp, not convoluted, also nice (aesthetic). 

Response 2

a) To spread awarness about data localization.

b) Nothing confusing as such, I just felt that it ended abruptly, it felt like the topic had just started and then it ended suddenly.

c) Umm more than persuasive, it made me curious to want to learn more, so I would follow one of those links in the end. I don't know if I would do it for advocacy though. 

d)Yes, learnt about something for sure.

e)The narration had a good flow. It seemed fine to me. 

f)I would suggest to tell more in the last section, about the implications of data restriction laws and also add a conclusion so that it does not look incomplete.

g)The visualizations were simple and effective. 

### Changes that I plan on
> Firstly, I would like to add more about the negative consequences of data localization. There are several, both for individuals and for the nations. However, I was not able to find data sets, for me to be able to visualize these points. I might add a diagram or visualization listing the different effects of data localization. I could also add a section about how there are other ways of ensuring data privacy and national security, even with data free flows. However, I don't want to make the presentation very text heavy. So I will see what I can do. Also, I have tried to not hammer down a particular narrative about whether data localization is completely good or completely bad, I can probably take a stronger stance. That might make the presentation more persuasive. I will take some feedback on that and then decide.
