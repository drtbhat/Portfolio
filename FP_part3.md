## Final Project Part 3

### The Final Data Story

> Follow [this link](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-data-localization-story/index.html) for my presentation slides in Shorthand.

#### Changes made since part 2

> My storyline remained the same since part 2, however, I added more text to make the presentation self-explanatory. As was communicated to me via user research, I added the costs of data localization in the very first part of the presentation to draw the audeince in and develop a sense of urgency. I also added blurbs throughout the presentation to have certain text pop out. Hopefully, I have made the text part simple for all audiences, making it more inclusive. Keeping my target audience in mind, I was able to add the 

> Design-wise, I got the feedback of having a more coherent visual language for my presentation. This way, I changed some of the colours in my visualization to a blue-green pallete. I added a common blue colour to slide headings and bulurbs, to add to the visual language. Shorthand allowed me to try out some interesting animations and I was able to include schromation and reveal in my presentation. I also found myself restricted with using the space as freely as I can with a blank slide in a Microsoft Powerpoint but again, the sophisticated transitions and ability to embed visualizations in SHorthand made up for it.
