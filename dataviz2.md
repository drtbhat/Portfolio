## Visualization 3.

Following visualization shows the Debt to GDP ratio of reporting countries from 1995 to 2021. Each box shows the trend for a particular country. Not each country started resporting from 1995, some lines are shorter based on when the country started resporting their debt to GDP ratio.

## Visualization 4.

The following visualization shows the debt to GDP ratio of reporting countries over the years.

In the previous visualizations, we saw dept to GDP ratios of countries in relation to each other and in relation with time. However, I wanted to create a visualization where the story isn't about a partiuclar country's debt to GDP ratio but the fact that countries have become more lenient about their debt to GDP ratio. For example, in the US, the debt ceiling was raised 78 times from 1962 till date, according to the US Department of Treasury. 

To tell this story, I tried flipping axes on the bar graph with time on x axis and value on y axis but that wasn't working out. I tried some other graphs in the bar graph and line graph category in Flourish. However, scrolling down, I landed on a bubble diagram, which in flourish was called the Hans Rosling chart and this is the visualization that I came up with. (play the video)

### Globally, Debt to GDP ratio rises over years
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/12586780"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In this bubble scatter plot, the x axis shows the different countries, the y axis shows the debt to GDP ratio and each slice in the animation shows time period. Each bubble is representing a country and the size of the bubble, the colour of the bubble are indicative of the debt to GDP ratios of the countries. If you were to pause the animation, hover your cursor over any bubble, information about the country name and the debt to GDP ratio of the country in that particular year will come up. However, these details are not required to understand the punchline of the visualization. The deep orange on the bubbles with increasing values of debt to GDP ratio, gives a sense of danger. This effect is designed to convey the negative connotation with high debt to GDP ratios which are a sign of a possible recession looming around the corner.
