# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data

# About me

I am graduate student of policy at Carnegie Mellon University. I am passionate about sustainability, education but more importantly evidence based policy making. 

# What I hope to learn

Whether it be writing research papers, blogs or news articles, I have experience with the written word. However, I wish to speak the non-literary visual language, especially to reveal insights from quantitative data. I hope to learn to understand what makes visualizations effective or ineffective. Through the course, I expect to be able to consistently deliver accurate and well-designed data visualizations for diverse audiences. 
After graduation, I hope to use these skills for policy research, communication and advocacy.
